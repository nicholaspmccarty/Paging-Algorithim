Paging Algorithm


This is a simple implementation of a paging algorithm in C++. The code simulates the behavior of a paging system and includes various test cases to evaluate different scenarios.


Features
Simulates a paging algorithm with FIFO and working set policies.
Generates different types of test data, including uniform random data, normal distribution data, and worst-case data.
Evaluates and prints the results of the paging algorithm for various test cases.

Test Cases
The program includes several test cases, each with different types of test data:

Uniform Random Data
Normal Distribution Data
Uniform Time Data
Normal Time Data
Worst Case Data
The test cases are designed to evaluate the paging algorithm's performance under different scenarios, such as random data, time-based data, and worst-case scenarios.

Enjoy experimenting with the paging algorithm implementation!
